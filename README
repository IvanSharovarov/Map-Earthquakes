In this course I learned some interesting things about OOP on java and built an application that takes 
earthquake data and shows it on a map with markers. Markers differ in size, shape and color depending on 
the location and power of an earthquake. When you put the mouse cursor over an earthquake, information about it is shown. 
As a result, the application has been extended to show the radius of an earthquake when you put the mouse cursor over it.

Used libraries: PGraphics, PApplet, Unfoldingmaps.
